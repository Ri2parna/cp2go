# cp2go

An interactive tracker for the **Get Better at CP in 2 Months** curriculum — the
same 8-week plan from [`README.md`](README.md), with click-to-check progress,
filters, and search instead of manually editing markdown checkboxes on a branch.

115 items across 2 months: 78 problems, 27 reading resources, 10 contests.

## Use it

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it — no server, no build step, no
dependencies. Double-clicking the file works.

## What it does

- **Progress ring** — overall completion, split by problems / reading / contests.
- **Per-week sidebar** — every week with a live `done/total` count.
- **Filters** — by kind, by platform (Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef,
  SPOJ, HackerEarth, AtCoder, cp-algorithms, …), by difficulty (the ★ ratings).
- **Search** — titles, platforms, section names. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to focus, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to clear.
- **Difficulty stars** and **platform badges** on every row.
- **Video badges** — a `▶ video` link on the reading items that have a
  companion YouTube lecture.
- Progress saves to `localStorage` as you click. `Reset progress` clears it
  behind a confirm.

## Keeping it in sync with upstream

`README.md` is the source of truth — this app does not hand-maintain a copy of
the curriculum. `build_data.py` parses it into `data.js`:

```bash
python3 build_data.py
```

```
wrote data.js: 2 months, 8 weeks, 115 items (115 checkboxes in README)
  problems=78 reading=27 contests=10
```

It is self-checking: it counts the checkboxes in the README and warns if the
parsed count doesn't match, so a silent upstream restructure can't quietly drop
problems. Run it after pulling upstream changes and commit the regenerated
`data.js`.

Item IDs are hashed from month + week + title + URL, so **your saved progress
survives upstream edits that only reorder or insert items.**

## Files

| File | Purpose |
